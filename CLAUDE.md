# Understand Anything

## Project Overview
An open-source tool combining LLM intelligence + static analysis to produce interactive dashboards for understanding codebases.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 22 (developed on v24)
- pnpm >= 10 (pinned via `packageManager` field in root `package.json`)

## Architecture
- **Monorepo** with pnpm workspaces
- **understand-anything-plugin/** — Claude Code plugin containing all source code:
  - **packages/core** — Shared analysis engine (types, persistence, tree-sitter, search, schema, tours, plugins)
  - **packages/dashboard** — React + TypeScript web dashboard (React Flow, Zustand, TailwindCSS v4)
  - **src/** — Skill TypeScript source for `/understand-chat`, `/understand-diff`, `/understand-explain`, `/understand-onboard`
  - **skills/** — Skill definitions (`/understand`, `/understand-dashboard`, etc.)
  - **agents/** — Agent definitions (project-scanner, file-analyzer, architecture-analyzer, tour-builder, graph-reviewer)

## Dashboard
- Dark luxury theme: deep blacks (#0a0a0a), gold/amber accents (#d4a574), DM Serif Display typography
- Graph-first layout: 75% graph + 360px right sidebar
- No ChatPanel or Monaco Editor
- Sidebar tabs: `Info` (ProjectOverview default → NodeInfo when node selected → LearnPanel in Learn persona, composing) and `Files` (FileExplorer tree built from the structural graph)
- Code viewer: prism-react-renderer source viewer that slides up from the bottom on file node click; an expand button promotes it into a full-screen modal. Source content is fetched from the dev server's `/file-content.json` endpoint, gated by access token + a graph-derived path allowlist
- Schema validation on graph load with error banner

## Agent Pipeline
- Agents write intermediate results to `.understand-anything/intermediate/` on disk (not returned to context)
- Agent model field is omitted from frontmatter so each platform falls back to its configured default — `inherit` was a Claude Code-only keyword that opencode (and similar tools) treated as a literal model id and rejected with `ProviderModelNotFoundError` (see #167)
- `/understand` auto-triggers `/understand-dashboard` after completion
- Intermediate files cleaned up after graph assembly

## Key Commands
- `pnpm install` — Install all dependencies
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build` — Build the core package
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core test` — Run core tests
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/skill build` — Build the plugin package
- `pnpm test` — Run all tests (skill tests live at repo-root `tests/skill/`, picked up by root `vitest.config.ts`)
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/dashboard build` — Build the dashboard
- `pnpm dev:dashboard` — Start dashboard dev server
- `pnpm lint` — Run ESLint across the project

## Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode everywhere
- Vitest for testing
- ESM modules (`"type": "module"`)
- Knowledge graph JSON lives in `.understand-anything/` directory of analyzed projects
- Core uses subpath exports (`./search`, `./types`, `./schema`) to avoid pulling Node.js modules into browser

## Gotchas
- **tree-sitter**: Uses `web-tree-sitter` (WASM) instead of native `tree-sitter` — native bindings fail on darwin/arm64 + Node 24
- **Dashboard imports**: Dashboard must only import from core's browser-safe subpath exports (`./search`, `./types`, `./schema`), never the main entry point which pulls in Node.js modules

## Scripts
- `scripts/generate-large-graph.mjs` — Generates a fake knowledge graph for performance testing (e.g. large-graph layout). Writes to `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`. Usage: `node scripts/generate-large-graph.mjs [nodeCount]` (default: 3000 nodes). Not part of the production pipeline.
- `scripts/generate-supply-chain-graph.mjs` — Generates a **real** knowledge graph of the AI supply chain (the same 11-layer logic as `docs/ai-supply-chain/README.md`: components, companies with 1-year stock data, upstream/downstream edges, bottlenecks, frontier R&D, and a guided tour). Structured as a pipeline of builder stages that mirror the agent pipeline (project-scanner → file-analyzer → domain-analyzer → architecture-analyzer → tour-builder → graph-reviewer), and validated against the core `validateGraph` schema. Writes to `docs/ai-supply-chain/knowledge-graph.json` (override with `--out <path>`, e.g. `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` to load it in the dashboard). Exports `buildGraph()` for tests (`tests/supply-chain/graph.test.mjs`). Requires core built first (`pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build`).
- `scripts/check-supply-chain-graph.mjs` — Production/CI guard: regenerates the graph in-memory and fails if it no longer passes `validateGraph` (anything dropped) **or** if the committed `docs/ai-supply-chain/knowledge-graph.json` differs from a fresh deterministic generation (stale/hand-edited). Wired into CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Graph commands & container
- `pnpm graph:supply-chain` — generate the graph (→ `docs/ai-supply-chain/knowledge-graph.json`).
- `pnpm graph:supply-chain:check` — validate + drift check (runs in CI).
- `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` — containerised generator. Build/run:
  ```bash
  docker build -t supply-chain-graph .
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/out" supply-chain-graph   # → out/knowledge-graph.json
  ```
  Multi-stage: the builder installs only the `@understand-anything/core` subtree (zod + web-tree-sitter, no native toolchain) and compiles the schema; the runtime runs the deterministic generator, writing to the `/out` volume. Override args after the image name (e.g. `--out /out/graph.json`).

## Versioning
When pushing to remote, bump the version in **all five** of these files (keep them in sync):
- `understand-anything-plugin/package.json` → `"version"` field
- `understand-anything-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field
- `.copilot-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field

Note: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` does **not** carry a version — the `plugins[]` entry only supports `name` and `source`, and adding other fields causes marketplace schema validation failures.

## Testing Local Plugin Changes

Claude Code caches installed plugins at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<version>/`. Symlinks don't work because Claude's Search/Glob tools can't follow them. To test local changes:

1. **Build the packages:**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build
   pnpm --filter @understand-anything/skill build
   ```

2. **Find the installed version** (must match what the marketplace currently serves):
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/
   ```

3. **Copy your local plugin into the cache**, replacing `<VERSION>` with the version from step 2:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<VERSION>
   cp -R ./understand-anything-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<VERSION>
   ```

4. **Start a fresh Claude Code session** (existing sessions cache the old prompts in context).

5. **Run `/understand --full`** in the target project to verify.

**Re-sync after further changes:**
```bash
pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build && \
cp -R ./understand-anything-plugin/* ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<VERSION>/
```

**To revert to upstream:** Uninstall and reinstall the plugin from the marketplace — it repopulates the cache from the upstream repo.
